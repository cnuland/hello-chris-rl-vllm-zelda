1. GAME OVERVIEW & STORY
================================================================================

Link arrives in the land of Holodrum where he meets Din, the Oracle of Seasons,
dancing with a troupe of performers. The evil General Onox attacks, kidnapping
Din and burying the Temple of Seasons underground into the subterranean world
of Subrosia. Without the Oracle, the seasons of Holodrum fall into chaos.

The Maku Tree, guardian of Holodrum, tells Link he must collect the 8 Essences
of Nature from 8 dungeons. These essences will produce the Huge Maku Seed,
which can penetrate the barrier around Onox's Castle in the Northern Peak.

KEY NPCs:
- Maku Tree: Guardian of Holodrum, gives the Gnarled Key and later the Huge
  Maku Seed after all 8 essences are collected.
- Din: Oracle of Seasons, kidnapped by Onox. Must be rescued.
- Impa: Zelda's nursemaid, accompanies the troupe at game start.
- Rosa: A Subrosian girl; give her a Ribbon and she helps access the Temple
  of Seasons to obtain the Summer power.
- Subrosians: Underground dwellers who live in Subrosia (volcanic underworld).
- Bipin & Blossom: Couple in Horon Village raising a baby; player choices
  affect the child's growth throughout the game.
- Maple: Witch's apprentice who flies overhead; bumping into her causes items
  to scatter. Trading sequence involves her.

================================================================================
2. CORE MECHANICS - ROD OF SEASONS
================================================================================

The Rod of Seasons is found in the Temple of Seasons in Subrosia. Initially it
has no power. Link must visit four towers in the temple to obtain each season:

  SEASON      | TOWER LOCATION     | WHEN OBTAINED
  ------------|--------------------|---------------------------------
  Winter      | SE Tower           | After Dungeon 1 (first visit to Subrosia)
  Summer      | After Rosa quest   | After Dungeon 2 (give Ribbon to Rosa)
  Spring      | Secret entrance    | After Dungeon 3 (Mt. Cucco area)
  Autumn      | Requires Bomb Flwr | After Dungeon 4 (Eyeglass Lake portal)

HOW TO USE: Stand on a tree stump and swing the Rod. The season cycles. Each
season changes the overworld environment:

  WINTER: Snow covers ground, water freezes (walkable), snow piles create
          ramps to higher ledges, some paths blocked by snowdrifts.
  SPRING: Flowers bloom, vines grow on walls (climbable), floods fill some
          areas, certain pits are covered by flowers.
  SUMMER: Vines grow fully, water in some areas dries up, heat wilts certain
          obstacles. Creepers grow to create ladders.
  AUTUMN: Leaves pile up in pits (walkable), mushrooms become pickable
          (can be tossed), Rocky Mushrooms can be picked with Power Bracelet.

The Rod also functions as a melee weapon (damages undead, knocks back others).
In the final Onox battle, use it to knock Din's crystal away when Onox uses
her as a shield.

FINAL STEP - NOBLE SWORD:
- Take Phonograph to the music-loving Deku Scrub in the Lost Woods
  area. He listens to the music and tells you how to find the
  Noble Sword.
- Path: North then west, stump > Winter > west, stump > Autumn >
  west, stump > Spring > west, stump > Summer > Noble Sword chest.
- NOTE: Give Mushroom to Syrup regardless - she sells Potions (300
  rupees) afterward, which is very useful.

which Strange Flute you obtain. Each has different abilities:

RICKY (Kangaroo):

  over cliffs and holes.
- Best for: Navigating cliffs and elevated terrain.

DIMITRI (Dodongo):

  after winning Boomerang).

MOOSH (Winged Bear):
- Obtain: Buy Strange Flute from Horon Village shop (150 rupees).
